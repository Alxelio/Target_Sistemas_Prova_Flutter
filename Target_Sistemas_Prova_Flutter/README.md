# Target_Sistemas_Prova_Flutter
I had applied for a job at Target Sistemas Company and then I was requested to do some Flutter applications. Therefore I could be evaluated about my hard skills and so on.

# First of all, I created my Flutter project for some application platforms, like android, ios and web, and also having my signature with this command below.
flutter create --project-name projeto_flutter_target_sistemas --platforms android,ios,web --org br.com.estevesalxelio ./Target_Sistemas_Prova_Flutter
